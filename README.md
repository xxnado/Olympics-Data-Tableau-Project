# Olympics Data - Tableau Project

## Overview
This Tableau project was developed as part of a group project for the "Data Visualization for Business Analytics" course at NOVA School of Business and Economics. Data on the Olympic Games (summer and winter) between 1896 an 2016 was given, along with the task of presenting it in a meaningful way.

Data visualization involves crafting a narrative, so by adding additional datasets on GDP, the World Happiness Index, and Population Sizes three main questions are explored:

1. How does a country's economic development impact the athletic performance of its athletes?
2. What is the relationship between a nation's athletic performance and its population size and Happiness Index?
3. Are an athlete's performance outcomes associated with factors such as age, gender, height, and weight?

In all screenshots the filters are on default, besides the year (2016) and the season (summer).

## How to use

Download the `Workbook - Olympics.twbx` workbook file and open it in Tableau.

In the data folder, you can find the datasets used in the project. The data in `olympics cleaned.csv` was pre-processed in a separate Jupyter notebook.

However, you donâ€™t need the files in the data folder to run the .twbx workbook file!
