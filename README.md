# Olympics Data - Tableau Project

## Overview
In our Business Analytics Master's program at Nova School of Business and Economics, my team and I completed a project for our Data Visualization course. We were given Olympic data spanning from 1896 to 2016 and the task to present the data in a meaningful way. 

Data visualization involves crafting a narrative, so we added additional datasets on GDP, the World Happiness Index, and Population Sizes to explore three main questions:

1. How does a country's economic development impact the athletic performance of its athletes?
2. What is the relationship between a nation's athletic performance and its population size and Happiness Index?
3. Are an athlete's performance outcomes associated with factors such as age, gender, height, and weight?

Here are screenshots of the three dashboards we created (for questions 1-3) to give you a first impression before downloading any files.

In all screenshots the filters are on default, besides the year (2016) and the season (summer).

## How to use

Download the [Workbook - Olympics.twbx] workbook file and open it in Tableau.

In the data folder, you can find the datasets used in the project. The data in 'olympics_cleaned.csv' was pre-processed in a separate Python notebook.

However, you donâ€™t need the files in the data folder to run the .twbx workbook file!
